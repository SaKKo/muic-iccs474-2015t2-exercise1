1. Clone https://github.com/SaKKo/muic-iccs474-2015t2-exercise1
1. What is fibonacci?
1. Check code performance.
    1. How to improve?
1. There are 3 branches, `master` `memoize` `memoizer`
    1. We will use Memoize Pattern
    1. See the differences.
    1. Is it really faster?
    1. Merge `memoize` to master
    1. Merge `master` to `memomizer`
        1. fix conflicts
    1. Merge `memoizer` to `master`
1. Move to your own GIT
    1. Create your own repository in github or bitbucket
    1. run `git remote add myorigin <GitURL>`
        1. the default is `origin`
        1. you can see how many `remote` are there by running `git remote -v`
    1. run `git push myorigin master`
        1. check github if the code is updated.
1. Try removing `sakko` from default `origin`
    1. hint `git remote remove <OriginName>`
1. Try moving `myorigin` to `origin`
1. Try pushing and see if it works.
1. Try inviting your friends to your repositories.
    1. Give them write permission in Github
    1. Ask your friend to modify your repository.
        1. just add any code and `git push`.
        1. Figure out how to merge it.
            1. hint you must do `git pull` first so that your local repo is updated to the same state as github.
